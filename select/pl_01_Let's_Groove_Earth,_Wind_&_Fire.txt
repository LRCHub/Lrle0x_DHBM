Let's groove tonight
Share the spice of life
Baby slice it right
We're gonna groove tonight
Let this groove get you to move
It's alright

Let this groove
set in your shoes
So stand up
(alright)

Gonna tell
what you can do with my love
Alright
Let you know girl
You're looking good,
you're out of sight
Alright
Just move yourself
And glide
like a seven-forty-seven
And lose you're self in the sky
Among the clouds
in the heavens 'cause
Let this groove
light up your fuse
It's alright

Let this groove
set in your shoes
So stand up

Let this groove

It's alright

Let this groove
set in your shoes
So stand up

You will find a piece of mind
On the floor take a little time
Come and see, you and me
Make a little sign
I'll be there after a while
If you want my love
We can boogie on down
Down boogie on down
Down boogie on down yeah
Down boogie on down
Let's groove tonight
Share the spice of life
Baby slice it right
We're gonna groove tonight
